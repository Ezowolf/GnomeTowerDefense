# GnomeTowerDefense
2D Tower defense with Unity and artists. made for project AIM. This project was made in 3 weeks by me and another developer. We had 3 artists in our team. It ws for a school assignment. We used C#. I wrote most of the AI and in-game objects such as towers, and my co-developer Jimbo did all of the UI plus the wavespawner. This project was quite challenging but really fun in the end. We learned a lot by developing this game. I'm proud of my useage of lists.'
